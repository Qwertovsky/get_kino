Due to redesign of kinoposik.ru it's almost impossible to use it now.
The most important information there is user ratings and I would like to backup mine.

So here you can find a simple script to retrieve movie ratings for specific user.
Ratings with movie name, linke to image and link to kinopoisk page are stored in local sqlite database kinopoisk.db .
